# LionshaftGPT

LionshaftGPT is an experimental LLM research project focused on building a self-learning language model capable of evolving over time. Inspired by DeepSeek R1, this model introduces new techniques like Shared Latent Cache, full-layer LoRA integration, and generative replay for continual learning.

To understand how LionshaftGPT works and how to contribute, refer to the documentation and blueprint files included in the repository.
